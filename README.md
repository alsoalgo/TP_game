RULES

PLAYERS AND EQUIPMENT
1. Go is a game between two players, called Black and White.
2. Go is played on a plain grid of N horizontal and N vertical lines, called a board. Players can choose the board size from 7 to 19. 
3. Stones: Go is played with playing tokens known as stones. Each player has at their disposal an adequate supply (usually 180) of stones of the same color.

POSITIONS
1. At any time in the game, each intersection on the board is in one and only one of the following three states: 1) empty; 2) occupied by a black stone; or 3) occupied by a white stone. A position consists of an indication of the state of each intersection.

PLAY
1. Initial position: At the beginning of the game, the board is empty.
2. Turns: Black moves first. The players alternate thereafter.
3. Moving: When it is their turn a player make a play. A play consists of the following steps (performed in the prescribed order):
Step 1. (Playing a stone) Placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection (chosen subject to Rule 8 and, if it is in effect, to Optional Rule 7A). It can never be moved to another intersection after being played.
Step 2. (Capture) Removing from the board any stones of their opponent's color that have no liberties.
Step 3. (Self-capture) Removing from the board any stones of their own color that have no liberties.
4. Prohibition of suicide: A play is illegal if one or more stones of that player's color would be removed in Step 3 of that play.
5. Prohibition of repetition: A play is illegal if it would have the effect (after all steps of the play have been completed) of creating a position that has occurred previously in the game.

GAME CONTROL
1. Player should use "w", "a", "s" and "d" to move the stone.
2. Use enter to set the stone.
